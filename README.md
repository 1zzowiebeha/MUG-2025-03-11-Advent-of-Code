# MUG-2025-03-11-Advent-of-Code

Not sure exactly when we will discuss this.  We think at the March 11th
meeting.  That's how we named the repo.  The problems are from the [2024 Advent
of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024).  The goal is talk about languages.
The structure of the repo reflects this.  There's a directory for each
language.  **Everyone** is encouraged to participate.  Fork, make an
implementation, send us a Pull Request.  Just because someone else has already
used a given language, don't let that stop you.  Inside each language
directory, there is a directory for each contributor, then dayN subfolders for
the individual problems.

Your PR should be in the right language directory.  It should use or create a
subfolder for you; name it with your GitHub username.  Having tests is great!
Advent of Code problems all come with small sets of sample data as part of the
problem description.  If you **do** have tests, use that data.  Comments are
great!  How did you solve it?  Why did you use the techniques you used?  What
were the gotchas?  What could have been better?  What are you particularly
proud of?  If it needs an explanation to run it, provide a README.  **Do**
include the sample data from the problem description.  **Don't** include the
real data the web-site gave you (which is unique to you anyway); add a
.gitignore if that's helpful to you.  Solve the Day 1 problems.  If you like,
solve other days, too.

This is about languages, and techniques, and how people are different, and
having fun!
