# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my Advent of Code submission.

For this exercise I will use Python, as it's my strongest language.
Python is wonderfully elegant, and has an amazing community of developers.

## "TypeError: 'type' object is not subscriptable"

If you receive this error when you try to run the file, please
ensure you execute via Python 3.9+.

Built-in type annotation became a native feature in this version, which is why it is required to run.

Also ensure you are not in a virtual environment for a prior version of Python.
