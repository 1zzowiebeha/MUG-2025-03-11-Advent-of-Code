I did lots of fun things for Day 2.  So there are many things to see here:

  * implemented a brute-force answer and a smart answer, then benchmarked them
  * implemented a function that acts like a member, using a trait
  * split my implementation into main.rs and lib.rs so I could import stuff in other places
  * passed a function as a parameter
  * played with HashSets
  * made an enum and derived a bunch of traits
  * made type aliases
  * nested iterator stacks (look inside the map that's part of read_in_the_reports)
